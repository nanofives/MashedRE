# Deferred

Things deliberately not being worked on right now. Each row has a rationale and a re-pickup condition. Pure dumping ground; no analysis, no code lives here.

A row goes into DEFERRED when:
- It's outside the current phase's scope.
- It depends on something not-yet-done and we don't want to track that as an uncertainty.
- It's a "nice to have" that doesn't block any DoD.
- A stub or uncertainty is explicitly accepted as `wontfix` for v1.

## Active

| ID | Title | Why deferred | Re-pickup when | Phase tag |
|----|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
|    |       |              |                |           |

## Cleared (delivered or rejected)

| ID | Title | Outcome | Date |
|----|-------|---------|------|
|    |       |         |      |

## Conventions

- ID format: `D-NNNN`, monotonic, never reused.
- Re-pickup condition must be **observable** (a phase exits, a feature ships, a tool gains a capability) — not "later" or "when I feel like it."
- A DEFERRED row may reference S-NNNN or U-NNNN ids; in that case the original tracker entry stays, with a pointer to D-NNNN.
